                <h4>The new Trending T - shirts for Fashion</h4>
                <p>No matter your reason for designing a t-shirt, it’ll always involve a little bit of branding. If
                    you’re using t-shirts for promotional purposes, branding is your main goal. Even if it’s strictly
                    fashion, you’ll still need to weave consistent brand themes into all your products. For personal
                    use—like commemorating an event, for example—you want to make sure your t-shirt design communicates
                    clearly.

                    If you haven’t already, write out a list of the key themes, styles, and personality traits, you want
                    your brand and shirts to convey. Is your brand playful or serious? Edgy or conservative? Luxurious
                    or affordable? A focused t-shirt design can answer all of these questions at a glance.

                <h4>Half-Pants for summer</h4>
                <p>Shorts are a garment worn over the pelvic area, circling the waist and splitting to cover the upper
                    part of the legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire length of the
                    leg. They are called "shorts" because they are a shortened version of trousers, which cover the
                    entire leg, but not the foot. Shorts are typically worn in warm weather or in an environment where
                    comfort and airflow are more important than the protection of the legs.
